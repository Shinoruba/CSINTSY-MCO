# Combined Project Specifications

## MCO1 - State Based Models (Pathfinding Simulator)

### Overview
- **Release Date:** Sept 27, 2024  
- **Submission Date:** Oct 24, 2024  
- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  - LO1: Collaborative system building for optimized performance.  
  - LO5: Articulation of ideas in technical English.  

### Project Description
Students will model, develop, and evaluate search algorithms to simulate optimal pathfinding for eateries around DLSU. The program should dynamically adapt to changes in the goal state or state space (e.g., new or closed eateries).  

### Requirements  
1. **Algorithm Exploration:**  
   - Implement blind and heuristic search algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, A*).  
   - Ensure dynamic behavior for changing goals or state spaces.  

2. **Heuristics:**  
   - Incorporate subjective factors (e.g., personal preferences, reviews) to guide pathfinding.  

3. **Performance Comparison:**  
   - Compare algorithms based on time complexity, memory complexity, and optimality.  

4. **Creativity & Interaction:**  
   - Design an interactive user interface to display outputs creatively.  

5. **Originality:**  
   - Acknowledge references; no plagiarized code.  

### Deliverables  
- **Executable Program:** Folder named `App` with instructions (`README.txt`).  
- **Source Code:** Folder named `Source`.  
- **Report:** PDF named `Report.pdf` with:  
  - Cover page, introduction, methodology, results, references, and contributions.  

### Rubric  
- Program (5 marks)  
- Algorithm Understanding (5 marks)  
- Report (5 marks)  
- Presentation (5 marks)

## MCO2 - Logic Based Models (Family Relationship Chatbot)  

### Overview  
- **Release Date:** October 27, 2024  
- **Submission Date:** November 28, 2024  
- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  - LO3: Build and evaluate an expert system prototype.  
  - LO5: Articulate ideas in technical English.  

### Project Description  
Develop a chatbot using PROLOG (inference engine) and Python (interface) to understand and answer queries about family relationships.  

### Requirements  
1. **Knowledge Base:**  
   - Encode family relationship rules in PROLOG (e.g., `father(X, Y)`, `sibling(X, Y)`).  

2. **Chatbot Functionality:**  
   - Parse user prompts (statements/questions) and translate to PROLOG queries.  
   - Handle statements (add feasible facts) and questions (answer yes/no or list relationships).  
   - Reject invalid prompts gracefully.  

3. **Intelligent Inference:**  
   - Derive implicit relationships (e.g., infer "grandfather" from "father of father").  
   - Reject contradictions (e.g., "Lea is the mother of Lea").  

### Deliverables  
- **Source Code:** Includes PROLOG knowledge base and Python interface.  
- **Instructions:** `instructions.txt` for running the program.  
- **Report:** PDF covering:  
  - Introduction, knowledge base design, implementation, results, limitations, and contributions.  

### Rubric  
- Correctness and intelligence of inferences.  
- Handling of edge cases and contradictions.  
- Clarity and completeness of the report.
